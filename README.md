# Details-Damage-Meter-for-3.3.5a
Details Damage Meter backported for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a Wrath of the Lich King

# Some information
Addon works quite well for Ulduar and Trial of the (Grand) Crusader and VoA.  
I also started to work on Naxxramas, but I don't have it on my computer anymore.  
Icecrown Citadel needs also to be done (See Details_RaidInfo-ToC). I've never done ICC so couldn't finish it on my own.

# Installation

Copy all directories into AddOns directory.
DBM directories are needed for Details Encounter Details to work.

# Final words
Sadly I'm don't have time to play WoW anymore so I can't finish the backport.  
My goal was to finish this AddOn and then publish it, but didn't manage to do so :P  
If anyone is interested in continuing my work feel free to do so (just mention my name somewhere, it's my baby <3).
