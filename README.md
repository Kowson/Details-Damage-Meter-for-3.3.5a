# Details-Damage-Meter-for-3.3.5a
Details Damage Meter backported for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a Wrath of the Lich King (WotLK).

# Some information
Addon works quite well for Ulduar and Trial of the (Grand) Crusader and VoA.  
Icecrown Citadel needs also to be done (See Details_RaidInfo-ToC). I've never done ICC so couldn't finish it on my own.

# Installation

1. Download **[Latest Version](https://github.com/Kowson/Details-Damage-Meter-for-3.3.5a/releases/latest)**
2. Unpack the Zip file
3. Open the folder "Details-Damage-Meter-for-3.3.5a-(#.#.##)"
4. Copy (or drag and drop all folders) into your WoW-Directory\Interface\AddOns
5. Restart WoW

DBM directories are needed for plugin Encounter Details to work.
